			<uL>
				<li>Active plugins per site.</li>
				<li>Contact info (from the custom field) for each site.</li>
				<li>Whether each site is discouraging indexing</li>
				<li>Whether each site is using a Homepage Link feature.</li>
				<li>Number of media attachments and space used for each site.</li>
				<li>A breakdown of the page templates used on each site.</li>
				<li>The number and status of posts on each site</li>

                <h4>Profiles</h4>
                <p>This plugin leverages Custom Post Types, the Shortcode API, and the <a href="https://github.com/WebDevStudios/cmb2" target="_blank">CMB2</a> library to create a Profile type, simplifying the addition of people to listings within the College of Engineering WordPress network.  In addition to the single profile view, it allows both a list and a grid view of groups of profiles, is filterable by type, tag, and ID, and is sortable by name.</p> 
		<h4>Hide Custom Fields</h4>
		<p>Hide Custom Fields is a plugin that uses Javascript with JQuery to hide unused custom fields on the "edit page" screen in the dashboard, based on the currently-selected page template.</p>
