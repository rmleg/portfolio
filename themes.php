					<h3>WordPress Themes</h3>

<p>I love to take mocked up designs and turn them into fully-featured, responsive WordPress themes.  However, what follow are themes I have designed and built myself.</p>


					<ul class="bxslider">
					  <li><img src="images/screenshots/newtheme-responsive-right.png" />
					  	<p>&nbsp;</p>
					  	<p>I built this fully-responsive blog theme using starter theme <a href="http://underscores.me" target="_blank">Underscores</a> as a base.  Underscores gave me the functions to make my blog work great, and I gave it the style to make my blog look great.  This theme has several different color options and other customizations available in the Theme Customizer.  <a href="http://blog.rachelleggett.com" target="_blank">View a Live Demo</a></p>

					  	<p>&nbsp;</p>
					  	<p>I built this fully-responsive blog theme from scratch.  It is a bare-bones WordPress theme and was my first responsive design.<!--  <a href="http://rachel.nu" target="_blank">View a Live Demo</a>--></p>
					  	<p>&nbsp;</p></li>
					  <li><img src="images/screenshots/sophistique.png" />
					  	<p>&nbsp;</p>
					  	<p>This non-responsive theme is highly stylized for a personal blog with focus on content and interesting flourishes.  This is not something I would release today, but I like to showcase it for the artistic design elements.  <a href="sophistique.htm" target="_blank">View a Live Demo</a></p>

					  	<p>&nbsp;</p>
					  	<p>I designed this website for the Michigan Running Club during my time as their webmaster.  They needed a simple website that would offer plenty of information for perspective runners as well as for current club runners and their families.</p>
